                            <p>
                                I was inspired to start this project after seeing other programmers make
                                procedural/generative designs using code.
                                The purpose of this was to test how vector fields could manipulate objects in space as
                                they moved across the plane,
                                and see what behaviors arose from an aggregate of forces. Each canvas initializes a
                                thousand objects whose
                                physical properties are constantly being updated in relation to the force at each point.
                                It takes some simple vector
                                operations to get this working, but the end result is spectacular. Above is a screenshot
                                of how the forces guide the
                                objects' paths over time. I added some nice trails to add some nice flow-y-ness to it.
                                Kind of reminds me of a seabed of anemone.

                            <h2>Truchet Tiles</h2>

                            <p>
                                I learned about truchet tiles about a year ago when I was watching a youtuber make these
                                from scratch.
                                Basically, these are tiles that are rotationally asymmetric, meaning that you don't get
                                the same shape
                                after rotations. When assembled together, they can form varied patterns depending on
                                each tile's
                                orientation. Being the creative genius I am, I did look to the internet for help, but it
                                was pretty amazing
                                to see intricate patterns emerge nothing from randomness. The one above uses tiles made
                                out of
                                quarter circles and lines.

                            <p>
                                A summer project during my time at SDSC. The goal of the project was to create 
                                an Android Mobile Application targeted towards plant caretakers and enthusiasts. 
                                Bloom Book, as the name suggests, enables users to track and manage plants in their 
                                collection. It comes with a fun camera UI to take photos for their journals, a 
                                reminder system that interfaces with your device's notifications (real-time reminders!),
                                and third-party APIs for exploring different types of plant information. Our stack included
                                Kotlin as our main language, Jetpack Compose UI for building visual components, and Firebase 
                                as our backend.

                            <p>
                                One of my earlier React projects that I created when I was learning the framework with FreeCodeCamp.
                                The UI comes with interactive keys that each play different sounds and a panel that configures the 
                                bank/theme, a power switch, and a volume slider. While challenging to make, it was a fun experience that 
                                taught me a lot about managing states and responsive design.

                            <p>
                                Another early endeavor into React with FreeCodeCamp. This was my first time fetching data from 
                                APIs online which was extremely cool to a newbie like me. The app comes with an interface 
                                to refresh quotes that are pulled from an API and then displays the info on the card. I also 
                                decided to make it fun to use by making the colors change with every new quote. It is a bit
                                buggy in terms of UI experience but my old self didn't bother to fix it.

                            <p>
                                When I joined UCSD's ACM AI committee, the club was looking to revitalize its website. My role 
                                as a frontend developer was to wireframe and implement a new style that would attract a new 
                                audience. Below is a snapshot of my earlier renditions on Figma. My goal was to make it 
                                modern and simple, so I researched how other companies designed their UI. I took inspiration from 
                                multiple sources including <i>Apple's Develop</i>. The final product is a website that 
                                feels fresh, fun, and interactive. Its color palette is mostly greys with pops of red and black 
                                to keep in line with a modern feel.
